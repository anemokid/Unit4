Unit 4 Mid Assessment 

- I was able to complete 3 steps by the end of the assessment. 
- I found the parts that were easy to implement : 
    - creating JSON Objects 
    - parsing JSON objects
    - creating POJOS
    - creating models 
    - sending a user to a different fragment based on a button click 
    - creating Fragments 
- I found these parts hard to implement: 
    - recycler view
    - getting my fragments to run together instead of crashing my app 
    - implementing the recycler view into the bottom frgament and incorporating it along with the top fragment 
      was something i found super hard to implement
